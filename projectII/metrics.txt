Metrics

The metric functions are saved as matlab files with specific names.
The names follow the pattern "metric_<type>.m"
Each of this functions need an simulink output structure as the first parameter.

N -> Number of agents
CtSi -> Indicates the Convergence time for the Agent Si


1. System Convergence Time (SCT) -> maximum between CtSi, where i=1..N;
2. Complete Agents Convergence time (CACT) -> sum of CtSi, where i=1..N;
3. Agent Convergence Crder (ACO) -> returns the agents in order of convergence time;
4. Global Disagreement Error (GDE) -> returns y-y0 for each agent.
