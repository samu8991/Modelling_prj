# Received signal strenght
It is the power of the received signal
The IEEE standard () defines it as follows:

$$ RSS(d) = P_t - \overline{P}_I - 10 \alpha log_{10}({d}/{d_0}) + \xi $$
Where
- $P_t$ is the transmission power,
- $P_i$ is the average path loss of the environment
- $\alpha$ attuenuation coefficient
- $d$ is the distance
- $d_0$ reference distance
- $\xi$ is the random noise
