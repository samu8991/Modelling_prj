To solve [[Compressed sensing]]

Coherence condition states that[^1] 
$$ k < \frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{\mu(A)}) $$
then the solution to the LASSO problem identifies the correct support
Where the support is defined as _the set of indices of the non-zero components of a vector_ and holds that
$$ k = ||x||_0 = |S|$$
