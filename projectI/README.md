# Indoor localization and tracking using a fingerprinting method with a Wireless Sensors Network

The aim of this project is to analyze some aspects of the fingerprinting tracking method. The implemented algorithms are: Iterative Soft Thresholding and Distribute Iterative Soft Thresholding. 
There are two versions of this project:

- project_oop, which is an OOP version of the system, implemented in matlab. No further reading is available for this project and the development was stopped for it. Nevertheless it is conceptually more similar to real life.

- project_code, which basically contains the same code, but this was expanded to complete the assigned task. A README is available inside explaining everything regarding the code, alongside with a report.md and report.pdf which explains the performed experiments and the results.
